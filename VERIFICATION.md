# Verification Log

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap
- [x] Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold created (app/, lib/supabase/*, components/, types/)
- [x] PWA foundation: manifest.json, sw.js, real generated PNG icons (192/512), service worker registration wired via `components/shared/service-worker-register.tsx` and Next.js `metadata`/`viewport` APIs in `app/layout.tsx`
- [x] Build gate: `npm run typecheck` — 0 errors (2 real type errors found in incoming draft code and fixed: unnarrowed `process.env` values used inside closures in `lib/supabase/client.ts`/`server.ts`, and an implicitly-`any` `setAll` cookie handler)
- [x] Build gate: `npm run lint` — 0 warnings/errors
- [x] Build gate: `npm run build` — succeeds, static export of `/` and `/_not-found`
- [x] Mobile gate: 375×812 viewport, `scrollWidth === clientWidth` (375 === 375), no horizontal scroll, screenshot captured
- N/A RLS gate (no database yet)
- N/A Data/cascade gate (no database yet)
- 🟡 Icons are a placeholder teal "S" mark (real PNGs, not the AI-claimed-but-nonexistent ones from the first draft) — replace with real school branding later, already externalized to `public/icons/`
- [x] Supabase project created: `school-app` (ref `khmvmympvnrxiplvggbw`, ap-southeast-1, free tier)
- [x] GitHub repo created: https://github.com/shahlal07/school-app (private)
- [x] Vercel project created and linked: kashif11/school-app, auto-deploys from `main`
- [x] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL / NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY set on Vercel (production/preview/development)
- 🟡 SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: pending — owner setting this directly via `vercel env add` so the secret never passes through chat
- [x] Production deployment READY: https://school-app-kashif11.vercel.app
